# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```

Type 1 Slowly Changing Dimension in this case would mean that the customer addresses changes are OVERWRITTEN. 

The design for Type 1 would be such that:

CustomerID -- PK
Address
City
Province
Postal Code
Country
Last Updated


Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension in this architecture would RETAIN changes as new rows. All address changes for each customer would be retained.

The design for Type 2 architecture:
CustomerAddressID -- PK
CustomerID
Address
City
Province
Postal Code
Country
StartDate
EndDate
IsCurrent

Notice how in Type 2 that the CustomerAddressID is the Primary Key and that each address would be unique. This way when a customer's address changes, a new row would be added to the table while preserving the old address.

There could be potential privacy implications for Type 2 due to retaining historical customer addresses that may not be neccessarily anymore, but it would still contain sensitive informaiton. 

```

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://imgur.com/a/u0m8fX6)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
There are several differences that I noticed in the AdventureWorks Schema and my ERD. 

-AdventureWorks has schema separations; for example Sales, Person, Purchasing, Human Resources are all clearly defined and divded by context
    -each of these schemas has its own table and foreign key relationship
